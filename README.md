# school-schedule

A course project (first year), written in Delphi, for "Algorithmization and programming basics" at BSUIR.

This program is meant to be a school diary, where you can write, rewrite, or delete your home tasks. 
It has 2 levels of access: a pupil and a teacher. As a pupil, you can view, write, or rewrite your home task, 
or view your marks. As a teacher, you have an access to all diaries of all students you have in your class, 
you can add a home task, marks, and notes, correct or rewrite pupilâ€™s home tasks.
